Save sessions tabs to planetscale. It is a project that lets user save tabs to a planetscale db through a vercel api endpoint. It functions similar to onetab only difference being it lets users save the tabs to a planetscale db. It is completely self hostable using your own instance of mysql db instead of planetscale and local rust server instead of using vercel endpoint.
